emacs.d
=======
My custom emacs configuration.


A lot of the boiler code in the beginning comes from
[bbatsov's](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs.d/) configuration.

Thoughts
--------
My general goal with my emacs configuration is to be both minimal, but 
functional as more than a text editor. Emacs is a program I always tend to come
back to due to how customizable it is.


I'm a pretty big fan of vim, so naturally a lot of my configuration is focused
about making it more "vim-like" by use of [evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)
and [evil-collection](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection).


Due to this being my personal emacs configuration, it is subject to change.
